00:00->00:01 Hibbie: What will you do with your time?
00:02->00:05 Matthew: I've got a job in Ripon. I said I'll start tomorrow.
00:06->00:07 Robert: A job? 
00:08->00:10 Matthew: In a partnership. You might have heard of it. Hartling Carter.
00:11->00:17 Matthew: They need someone who understands industrial law, I'm glad to say, although I'm afraid most of it will be wills and conveyancing.  
00:17->00:20 Robert: You do know I mean to involve you in the running of the estate.
00:21->00:23 Matthew: Oh don't worry. There are plenty of hours in the day.
00:23->00:25 Matthew: And of course I'll have the weekend.
00:26->00:28 Robert: We'll discuss this later we mustn't bore the ladies. 
00:29->00:31 Violet: Well what is the weekend?
