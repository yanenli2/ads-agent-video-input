00:00->00:01 Rachel: What did you get her?
00:04->00:05 Chandler: A pen.
00:06->00:10 Joey: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?
00:12->00:13 Chandler: You can't give her that.
00:13->00:14 Joey: Why not?
00:14->00:16 Chandler: Because she's not 11!
00:16->00:19 Chandler: And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah!
00:23->00:29 Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that is... well this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives.
00:30->00:31 Joey: Sure it is.
00:31->00:36 Joey: She needs a pen for work. She's writing, she turns it over. Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!
00:40->00:43 Chandler: Alright, look, look. What...what did you get for Angela Del Vecchio for her birthday?
00:44->00:46 Joey: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
00:46->00:46 Chandler: For three years?
00:51->00:55 Joey: Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore. I...
00:57->00:57 Chandler: Hold on...
