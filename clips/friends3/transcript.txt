00:00->00:02 Chandler: Well yeah, you don't look good Joey.
00:04->00:06 Joey: Well the fridge is broke, so I have to eat everything.
00:09->00:11 Joey: Cold cuts, ice cream, limes...
00:11->00:14 Joey: Hey, what was in that brown jar?
00:14->00:15 Chandler: That's still in there?
00:15->00:16 Joey: Not anymore.
00:18->00:20 Joey: So anyway, how do you wanna pay me?
00:23->00:24 Chandler: Is this a service you're providing me?
00:26->00:30 Joey: No. No. No. For my new fridge. For our new fridge.
00:30->00:33 Chandler: Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
00:33->00:34 Joey: So what?
00:35->00:37 Joey: Look, okay. Suppose we were a, uh, divorced couple.
00:37->00:38 Chandler: Uh-huh.
00:39->00:40 Joey: And I got custody of the kid, right?
00:40->00:45 Joey: Now, suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
00:48->00:49 Chandler: Okay.
00:51->00:52 Joey: Give me 400 dollars!
