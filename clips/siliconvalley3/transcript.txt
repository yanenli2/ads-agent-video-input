00:00->00:02 Lady: Ah, Bertram. While I have you.
00:03->00:05 Bertram: You don't have me.
00:06->00:09 Lady: Richard's just asked me with streamlining productivity and balancing head count.
00:10->00:13 Lady: Can you explain to me why you have no one working under you?
00:14->00:18 Lady: Just seems odd considering the agile board is showing that you have a massive back log. 
00:19->00:23 Bertram: You are new here, so I'll forgive the patronizing tone.
00:23->00:27 Bertram: I'm more concerned with being right than being fast. 
00:28->00:29 Bertram: And I don't like dealing with people.
00:30->00:32 Bertram: To wit. Are we done?
