00:00->00:03 Chugtai: He was acting like your boss, and you were acting like his noob employee.
00:03->00:04 Hendricks: No. Everyone knows I am the boss.
00:04->00:09 Hendricks: I think people were just excited to, you know, razz the CEO. It's all in good fun.
00:09->00:10 Chugtai: I did not have fun.
00:11->00:13 Chugtai: I watched you get kicked in the balls for 90 minutes.
00:13->00:15 Chugtai: My balls hurt sympathetically for your balls.
00:15->00:16 Chugtai: Take off the sweater!
00:21->00:21 Hendricks: It's fine.
00:22->00:27 Hendricks: I mean, yes, Ethan can be a little prickly, but he is gonna get us to where we need to be.
00;27->00:30 Hendricks: And I don't mind putting my ego aside for the good of the company. 
00:31->00:35 Chugtai: That guy humiliating you was not good for the company. He dominated you like a silverback gorilla. 
00:36->00:38 Chugtai: Do you know why the gorillas respected Jane Goodall?
00:38->00:39 Hendricks: Jane Goodall studies chimpanzees.
00:40->00:43 Chugtai: Wrong! It's because she could kick their ass and they knew it.
00:43->00:46 Chugtai: You need to assert dominance like Jane Goodall. 
00:47->00:49 Chugtai: I have something to show you. You're gonna need this.
